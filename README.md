MNIST_EIP
1. Using 3x3 kernels you could not have used 3x3 (like in case you want to convert your channel resolution to 1x1).
2.Using MaxPooling operations after few layers (definitely not after the first layer) 
3.Not using Fully connected layers as they are obsolete)  


MNIST using Image augmentaion using 16k params achieved 99.33 accuracy
